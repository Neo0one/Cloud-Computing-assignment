Assignment 1:

IMPORTANT: 
1. Please do not press "Enter" in our web app, if you want to send the message, please click the "send!" button by mouse. There is still a small bug about frontend waiting to be fixed, and we will improve our frontend interface in next assignment.

2. The NLP function of our app is still very naive, so please be sure to use the following sentences as input so that you can get a logical response. If you type something else, the robot will tell you: "I am sorry......".

Input:

Hello, my name is Robin.

I am good. What is your name?

It's a cool name, I think.
